You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order,and
two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.
Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside
the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements
denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should
be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.
